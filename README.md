# Transaction Risk Analysis & Control System（TRACS） Demo Video Script

**AI × Data × Decentralized Storage for Intelligent Transaction Risk Management**

---

## Product Overview

**Transaction Risk Analysis & Control System（TRACS） Demo Video Script** is a next-generation risk control system designed for e-commerce and payment platforms, leveraging **AI-driven analytics** and **decentralized storage via Walrus** to detect and prevent money laundering and other illicit transaction activities.

The system collects on-chain transaction data, merchant registration information, and historical transaction patterns in real-time, applies AI models to assess risk and generate actionable recommendations, and stores critical metadata, merchant profiles, and risk results on the **Walrus decentralized storage network**. This creates a **verifiable, tamper-resistant, and auditable record of every transaction**.

In this architecture:

* **AI provides intelligent judgment** – understanding transaction behaviors and risk patterns.
* **Data provides insight depth** – fusing multiple sources to create a comprehensive risk profile.
* **Walrus provides trusted storage** – ensuring secure, decentralized, and verifiable evidence for all assessments.

This combination forms a new infrastructure paradigm: **AI × Data × Decentralized Storage** for merchant transaction risk management.

## System Architecture & Core Workflow

### 1. Multi-Source Data Collection

At the moment a merchant initiates an on-chain payment, the system collects:

* On-chain transaction details: payer address, transaction amount, product information, timestamp;
* Merchant registration data: industry type, business scale, operational scope;
* Historical transaction patterns: average order value, transaction frequency, refund rate, activity cycles.

These multi-dimensional data points construct a dynamic behavioral profile of each merchant.

### 2. AI Risk Engine

The AI-powered risk engine performs feature extraction and multi-dimensional analysis:

* **Risk Scoring** – continuous risk value indicating the probability of suspicious activity;
* **Risk Type Identification** – detecting potential money laundering paths, abnormal payment behaviors, or high-risk aggregation of receipts;
* **Intelligent Recommendations** – automatically generating actions such as approve, manual review, freeze, or limit transactions.

The AI model continuously learns from new data, optimizing detection accuracy and adaptability to evolving merchant behaviors.

### 3. Walrus Decentralized Storage Layer

To ensure **trustworthy and persistent storage**, key metadata and AI outputs are stored on **Walrus**, including:

* Merchant transaction summaries and statistics;
* AI-generated risk scores and recommendations;
* Audit-relevant timestamps and signatures.

Walrus provides:

* **Tamper-resistance** – distributed storage prevents single-party modifications;
* **Verifiability** – content-addressable storage allows proof of data authenticity;
* **High scalability** – supports large files, unstructured reports, and audit evidence storage.

Together, AI analysis plus Walrus storage forms a **trusted evidence layer** for audits, dispute resolution, and regulatory review.

### 4. Ecosystem Integration & Extensibility

Merchant Transaction Risk Query supports a multi-layered ecosystem:

* **Payment Platform Integration** – embedded real-time risk control within on-chain payment systems;
* **Open API Access** – enabling external developers and platforms to leverage AI risk analytics and Walrus storage;
* **KYT (Know Your Transaction) Data Integration** – incorporating on-chain blacklists, high-risk addresses, and contracts to enhance risk detection;
* **Cross-Merchant Learning Network** – privacy-preserving aggregation of anonymized features improves AI generalization and industry-wide insights.

---

## Compliance & Audit Friendliness

* **Verifiable Evidence** – all AI outputs are stored on Walrus and can be independently verified.
* **Flexible Thresholds** – platforms and merchants can customize risk control rules within a unified tolerance range.
* **Data Security & Privacy** – hash-based storage and minimal on-chain footprint protect sensitive information.
* **Regulatory Compatibility** – supports AML, KYT, and SAR reporting requirements.

---

## Product Value

* **Intelligent Risk Control** – real-time anomaly detection and actionable recommendations using AI.
* **Trusted Evidence Layer** – Walrus ensures tamper-resistant, verifiable storage of risk data.
* **End-to-End Coverage** – integrates merchant systems, payment platforms, and KYT networks for comprehensive protection.
